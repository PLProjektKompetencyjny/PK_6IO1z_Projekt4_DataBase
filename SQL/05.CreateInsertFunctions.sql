    .DESCRIPTION
        SQL script for PostgreSQL to define INSERT functions in TravelNest DB.
        EXISTING FUNCTIONS WILL BE REMOVED AND RE-CREATED WITH THIS FILES' DEFINITION.

        This file is suposed to define all insert functions,
        which will be used in INSTEAD OF INSERT view triggers.

		Following actions will be performed in a given order:
			1. CREATE OR REPLACE all functions from scratch


    .RULES
		- Names consisted of more than 1 word must use '_' as words separator.
			Object names such as tables, constraints, functions are not case sensitive,
			so to make them easy easy-readable please use word separator.

        - Insert function must have a prefix 'insert_' followed by <view_name> in the name. 
            Beacause all functions are located in the common Object explorer directory.

        - Insert function must return NULL if operation was successful, 
            otherwise raise an descriptive exception, which will be capture by backend.

        - Insert function can be written in SQL or PL/Python, both languages are supported,
            however RECOMMENDED FOR DATA MODIFICATION IS SQL.

        - Inser function must handle everything related to inserting record to DB,
            including all insert statements to any related table
